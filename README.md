# Hey, I'm Wellbyt3 ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Security Researcher currently competing in public security contests. I ranked #2 in the [Gamma Liquidiy Management contest](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2025-02-gamma/results?lt=contest&page=1&sc=reward&sj=reward&t=leaderboard) and completed an internship with [Pashov Audit Group](https://github.com/wellbyt3/wellbyt3/blob/main/wellbyt3-pashov-internship.png).

Audit contests were my first real introduction to blockchains and web3. Before that, I worked as an analytics engineer in FinTech, where I built data pipelines and analyzed data to help teams make more informed decisions. That background makes me especially enjoy auditing DeFi protocols, since many of them embed a similar kind of business math.

Prior to that, I founded an SEO analytics firm where we reverse-engineered search engine ranking algorithms and used those insights to help clients increase traffic to their websites. We developed some proprietary tooling that automated the SEO analysis process, which led to the firm being acquired.
